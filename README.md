# YouTube Link-Player
This script allows you to open any YouTube hyperlink as an embedded video. Which saves you the hassle of opening new tabs to watch a shared video, or having to keep leaving and returning to the comment section when clicking on timestamps.

## Install
Firefox:
[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/youtube-linkplayer/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/youtube-linkplayer/)<br>
Edge:
[https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/dmikdghhabolmcokdbajfbdicpebeiic](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/dmikdghhabolmcokdbajfbdicpebeiic)

## Usage
A red button should appear next to any YouTube hyperlink on any page, click it to reveal the embedded video and click it again to hide the video. If a link doesn't have a button, right-click it and select "Youtube Link-player" from the context menu to reveal the video. If a link is formatted as plain-text rather than a hyperlink, highlight it first then right-click it.
